# ❓ Problem
Language barriers currently result in a poor user experience for both international and English-speaking users, as they need to switch apps to Google Translate for translations. 
<br>
<br>
Many users having been asking for a translation feature, which is why I built Translate Bot. It's currently live, try it out! 🌎🚀
